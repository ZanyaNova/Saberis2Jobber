) as unit price
- Create a negative number that is the difference between post-mutlipier and markup, and add this as a discount line.
- No longer limit quote to approved quotes (sort by recently created?)
- Saberis needs what design2020 name fields filled out to display?
- Grab all quotes
- Make quotes vs jobs tab
- Make catalogs without an entry require the mult and margin added
- Move "send to jobber" button onto the card, like Clear Entries is
